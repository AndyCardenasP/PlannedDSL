Planned is a Domain Specific Language specialized to design academic schedules, so it allows users to add, delete, and check  classes for an academic period. It also has a possibility to save and load past academic schedules in a file .txt extension.

A model is constructed from valid Planned DSL expressions using textX, and from the model (that passes the semantic check), the application source code and other required files are generated using python[12].

In future Planned can be extended with a GUI for more friendly experience with users that has no knowledge about programming.
